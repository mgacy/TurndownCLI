# TurndownCLI

A simple command-line interface for [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown), an HTML to Markdown converter.

This is intended primarily to support [SwiftyTurndown](https://github.com/mgacy/swifty-turndown), a Swift package for converting HTML to Markdown. [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) is used to create executables for SwiftyTurndown to download and for which it serves as an interface.
